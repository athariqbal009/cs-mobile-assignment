This app made up of using the `MVVM` architecture with following dependencies:
1. Android lifecycle: ViewModel, LiveData 
2. Network Library: For consuming API and received data from server `Retrofit` will be used. It is ease of use, fast, internally response parsing using `GSON`.
3. Image Library: For movie poster loading am using `Coil` kotlin first image library. It will automatically handle image caching and memory.
